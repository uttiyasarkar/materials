        <p>1. p. 8, next-to-last paragraph, last line: ‚Äúwhen ùúÉ=0‚Äù, or any other specific value? </p>
		<p style="color:blue;">Yes it is at ùúÉ=0, i.e. after SSB, the expression of the field.</p>
	<p>2. p. 9, next-to-last sentence of 2.2.1: a ‚Äútheorem‚Äù is not a ‚Äúmethod‚Äù.</p>
	      <p style="color:green;">Thank you for the suggestion. "Method" is replaced by "theorem" at the first appearnce.</p>
	<p>3. p. 10, sentence between Eqs. (2.12-2.13): ‚ÄúThis clearly indicates‚Äù: may be help the reader a bit with something like ‚Äúthe field-independent coefficient of WW and (1/2)ZZ [I leave the super- and subscripts to be filled in] gives the squared mass of the W and Z boson, respectively‚Äù.</p>
		<p style="color:green;">The lines are changed to "The field-independent coefficient of $W^{\dagger}_{\mu}W^{\mu}$ and (1/2)$Z^{\mu}Z_{\mu}$ gives the squared mass of the W and Z boson, respectively. The gauge boson masses are related by"</p>
	<p>4. Table 2.2: Cite PDG or other sources for the numerical values.</p>
	        <p style="color:green;">Thanks, this is now included.</p>
	<p>5. p. 16: It might be useful to introduce the words ‚Äúwino‚Äù and ‚Äúbino‚Äù while you are at it: ‚Äúgaugino mixtures of wino (WÃÉ) and bino (BÃÉ) are called ‚Ä¶‚Äù. That better sets up Table 3.2, where we see that the photino and zino do not really show up in the MSSM.</p>
		 <p style="color:green;">Thanks for the comment. I have included the wino and bino with the symbols.</p>
	<p>6. p. 17, next-to-last sentence: I‚Äôd omit the ‚Äúit is more interesting‚Äù, since that is in the eye of the beholder. Maybe ‚Äúin this thesis we concentrate on‚Äù.</p>
		<p style="color:green;">Thanks for the suggestion. The sentence is modified.</p>
	<p>7. p. 52, line 6: I am not sure what is the reasoning for calling this version of T5ZZ a two-parameter scenario, when in the end you vary only one. I am not aware of any physics argument for the 50 GeV separation between gluino and NLSP masses that would prefer fixing that. It seems more of an experimental choice on the same footing as the chosen LSP mass.</p>
		<p style="color:orange;">Yes, you are right. So, we are not mentioning the model as two-parameter. There is no concrete physics arguement about the choice of the value 50 GeV, but we wanted to make sure about the specific boosted topology of the Z boson in the final state in order to scan the very specific phase space of the gluino production. So I have added one more line like, "These mass choices allow us to probe a very specific and unexplored gluino production phase space."  </p>
	<p>8. p. 63, second bullet: You could explain the ‚Äúadditional criterion to minimize the reduction in signal efficiency‚Äù by noting that if ùëù‚ÉóTmiss is aligned with the jet that is within a margin of the detector dead region, the resulting ùëù‚ÉóTmiss may be the result of some of the jet‚Äôs energy having gone undetected.</p>
		<p style="color:green;">Thanks, a sentence is added "The second criterion is especially helpful to minimize the reduction in signal efficiency as the fake $\met$ arises from the dead detector region where some of the real jet $\pt$ can go undetected."</p>
	<p>9. Figs. 5.5, 5.9: From the order in which these figures are mentioned in the text, it looks as if either the figures or their labels are swapped.</p>
		<p style="color:green;">Thanks for pointing this out. There was indeed one bad figure reference which was messing it up. Now fixed in the new version.</p>
	<p>10. p. 90, first sentence: This wording seems to be a circular definition of ùúá!</p>
	       <p style="color:green;">The sentence is rephrased to "In general, the 95\%  CL  upper limit is used as the standard in the limit settings where  $CL_{s}$= 0.05 for a given $\mu$."</p>

        <p>1. P8: Why v is there ? Isn‚Äôt supposed to be normalized state of (phi 1 +/- phi 2)?</p>
	<p style="color:blue;">This expression of field is at the ground state where the energy is minimum after SSB. So, phi_1 is v and phi_2 is zero. I have changed the field notation to \eta and \xi to avoid confusion.</p>
	<p>2. P11. Table 2.1: How do you experimentally measure the charge of quarks ? For that matter even how to experimentally find our quark have spin=1/2 and has 3 colours?</p>
		<p style="color:blue;"> There is no direct measurement of the fractional charge of the quarks, since quarks are never free and they are always in the bound states. 
			So to experimentally determine the fractional charge, color and spin of the quarks, we look for processes like electron-positron anhiliation. 
			The annihilation can produce muon-antimuon pairs or quark-antiquark pairs which in turn produce hadrons. 
			The hadron events are evidence of quark production and the process itself describes the spin 1/2 nature of the quarks.
			The ratio of the number of hadron events to the number of muon events gives a measure of the number of "colors" of the quarks. If the ratio were 1, then there would have been no color charge.
			The evidence points to five quarks with three colors. </p>		
	<p>3. P11. Table 2.2: Is there reason why range of weak interaction (10^-16) is smaller than the one mentioned below (which is for strong interaction ~ 10 ^-13 as shown by you)?</p>
		<p style="color:orange;"> The range depends on the energy scale of the theory. Weak interaction is a short range interaction where the parameter
			of the theory depends on W/Z mass, whereas the strong interaction makes sense at the nucleus of an atom which is about 10^-13 cm in radius.</p>
	<p> 4. P12: What is meaning of unification ? The three couplings should be exactly same or they should be related or something else?</p>
		<p style="color:blue;"> Here, by unification we meant that all three fundamental forces can be described by a common theory which includes
			different couplings and term from all three forces. There can be unified theories where couplings are same at some high energy and the symmetry 
			of the theory is broken at some energy scale.</p>
	<p>5. P12: well, its not a new problem. The electron is lighter than protons and needed some explanation why ? It was raised by Dirac.</p>
		<p style="color:blue;"> Thanks for this important remark. Yes, naturalness is a common problem in many theories.</p>
	<p>6. P15. Eq. 3.1: This equation itself, does it solve hierarchy problem ?</p>
		<p style="color:blue;"> Not at all. It tells about a new symmetry in nature and formulates the algebra. The solution of the hierarchy problem 
			is an outcome of the algebra.</p>
	<p>7. P16: replace ‚Äúsfermions‚Äù by ‚Äúas sfermions‚Äù ?</p>
		<p style="color:green;"> Thanks, done.</p>
	<p>8. P16: Where is the neutralino and charginos in the list ?</p>
		<p style="color:blue;">  In this context, only gauge eigenstates are given. The charginos and neutralinos are explained while mentioning the mass eigenstates in Sec. 3.1.1.</p>
	<p>9. P16: why it MUST be broken ?</p>
		<p style="color:blue;"> Since we haven't observed any SUSY particle so far. If SUSY were not broken, we would have observed exactly same 
			SM particle spectrum but with a spin differing by 1/2 for all SM particles.
	<p>10. P17. Table 3.1:  think you should mention what each column represent in the below table ? For example what is S ?  Spin ? Always good to mentions the details of the table in caption.</p>
		<p style="color:green;"> Thanks for pointing this out, I have changed the text accordingly. </p>
	<p>11. P17: ‚Äúand s is the spin of a particle.‚Äù which particle ? SUSY or SM particles?</p>
