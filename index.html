        <p>1. p. 8, next-to-last paragraph, last line: ‚Äúwhen ùúÉ=0‚Äù, or any other specific value? </p>
		<p style="color:blue;">Yes it is at ùúÉ=0, i.e. after SSB, the expression of the field.</p>
	<p>2. p. 9, next-to-last sentence of 2.2.1: a ‚Äútheorem‚Äù is not a ‚Äúmethod‚Äù.</p>
	      <p style="color:green;">Thank you for the suggestion. "Method" is replaced by "theorem" at the first appearnce.</p>
	<p>3. p. 10, sentence between Eqs. (2.12-2.13): ‚ÄúThis clearly indicates‚Äù: may be help the reader a bit with something like ‚Äúthe field-independent coefficient of WW and (1/2)ZZ [I leave the super- and subscripts to be filled in] gives the squared mass of the W and Z boson, respectively‚Äù.</p>
		<p style="color:green;">The lines are changed to "The field-independent coefficient of $W^{\dagger}_{\mu}W^{\mu}$ and (1/2)$Z^{\mu}Z_{\mu}$ gives the squared mass of the W and Z boson, respectively. The gauge boson masses are related by"</p>
	<p>4. Table 2.2: Cite PDG or other sources for the numerical values.</p>
	        <p style="color:green;">Thanks, this is now included.</p>
	<p>5. p. 16: It might be useful to introduce the words ‚Äúwino‚Äù and ‚Äúbino‚Äù while you are at it: ‚Äúgaugino mixtures of wino (WÃÉ) and bino (BÃÉ) are called ‚Ä¶‚Äù. That better sets up Table 3.2, where we see that the photino and zino do not really show up in the MSSM.</p>
		 <p style="color:green;">Thanks for the comment. I have included the wino and bino with the symbols.</p>
	<p>6. p. 17, next-to-last sentence: I‚Äôd omit the ‚Äúit is more interesting‚Äù, since that is in the eye of the beholder. Maybe ‚Äúin this thesis we concentrate on‚Äù.</p>
		<p style="color:green;">Thanks for the suggestion. The sentence is modified.</p>
	<p>7. p. 52, line 6: I am not sure what is the reasoning for calling this version of T5ZZ a two-parameter scenario, when in the end you vary only one. I am not aware of any physics argument for the 50 GeV separation between gluino and NLSP masses that would prefer fixing that. It seems more of an experimental choice on the same footing as the chosen LSP mass.</p>
		<p style="color:blue;">Yes, you are right. So, we are not mentioning the model as two-parameter. There is no concrete physics arguement about the choice of the value 50 GeV, but we wanted to make sure about the specific boosted topology of the Z boson in the final state in order to scan the very specific phase space of the gluino production. So I have added one more line like, "These mass choices allow us to probe a very specific and unexplored gluino production phase space."  </p>
	<p>8. p. 63, second bullet: You could explain the ‚Äúadditional criterion to minimize the reduction in signal efficiency‚Äù by noting that if ùëù‚ÉóTmiss is aligned with the jet that is within a margin of the detector dead region, the resulting ùëù‚ÉóTmiss may be the result of some of the jet‚Äôs energy having gone undetected.</p>
		<p style="color:green;">Thanks, a sentence is added "The second criterion is especially helpful to minimize the reduction in signal efficiency as the fake $\met$ arises from the dead detector region where some of the real jet $\pt$ can go undetected."</p>
	<p>9. Figs. 5.5, 5.9: From the order in which these figures are mentioned in the text, it looks as if either the figures or their labels are swapped.</p>
		<p style="color:green;">Thanks for pointing this out. There was indeed one bad figure reference which was messing it up. Now fixed in the new version.</p>
	<p>10. p. 90, first sentence: This wording seems to be a circular definition of ùúá!</p>
	       <p style="color:green;">The sentence is rephrased to "In general, the 95\%  CL  upper limit is used as the standard in the limit settings where  $CL_{s}$= 0.05 for a given $\mu$."</p>

        <p class="c6"><span class="c0">1. P8: Why v is there? Isn&rsquo;t supposed to be a normalized state of (phi 1 +/- phi 2)?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">This expression of field is at the ground state where the energy is minimum after SSB. So, phi_1 is v and phi_2 is zero. We have changed the field notation to</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;\eta </span><span class="c9">and</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;\xi </span><span class="c5">to avoid confusion.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">2. P11. Table 2.1: How do you experimentally measure the charge of quarks? For that matter even how to experimentally find our quark has spin=1/2 and has 3 colors?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">There is no direct measurement of the fractional charge of the quarks, as they are never free and are always found in the bound states of hadrons (color confinement). To experimentally determine the fractional charge, color, and spin of the quarks, we look for processes like electron-positron annihilations. These annihilations can produce muon-antimuon pairs or quark-antiquark pairs which in turn produce hadrons. The hadronic events are evidence of quark production and the process itself describes the spin-1/2 nature of the quarks. The ratio of the number of hadron events to the number of muon events gives a measure of the number of &ldquo;colors&rdquo; of the quarks as well as the evidence of the fractional charge. If the ratio were 1, then there would have been no color charge and the ratio would have just accounted for the fractional charges. The evidence points to five quarks with fractional charges with three colors. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">3. P11. Table 2.2: Is there a reason why the range of weak interaction (10^-16) is smaller than the one mentioned below (which is for strong interaction ~ 10 ^-13 as shown by you)?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The weak interaction is a short-range force because of the high mass of its messenger particles namely W and Z bosons. For a mass of ~100 GeV, one can calculate the range (r ~ 1/m) to be 10^-16 cm. On the other hand, the range of strong interaction depends on the distance scale where the linear confining term takes over the Coulomb term 1/r in the potential. This is typically the size of the nucleus of an atom which is about 10^-13 cm in radius.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">4. P12: What is the meaning of unification? The three couplings should be exactly the same or they should be related or something else?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">By unification, we mean that all three fundamental forces can be described by a common theory which includes different couplings and terms from all three forces. These unified theories have the same coupling strengths for all forces at some high energy and at lower energy scale the symmetry of the theory is broken leading to a difference in strengths.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the connection to the SM, we realize that the phrase &ldquo;</span><span class="c20">amazingly unifies</span><span class="c9">&rdquo; might be misconstrued and have thus changed it to &ldquo;</span><span class="c10">incorporates</span><span class="c5">&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">5. P12: Well, it&rsquo;s not a new problem. The electron is lighter than protons and needed some explanation why? It was raised by Dirac.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Thanks for this important remark. Yes, naturalness is a common problem in many theories. In the case of electrons, it is like a point particle, whereas the proton is a bound state of quarks and gluons. The observed mass of leptons (electrons etc.) and free quarks can be explained by the Yukawa coupling, however for protons and neutrons the observed masses are dominated by the strong interaction between quarks and gluons.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">6. P15. Eq. (3.1): This equation itself, does it solve the hierarchy problem?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Not at all. It tells about a new symmetry in nature and formulates the algebra. The solution of the hierarchy problem is an outcome of the algebra.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">7. P16: replace &ldquo;sfermions&rdquo; by &ldquo;as sfermions&rdquo; ?</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10">Done.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">8. P16: Where is the neutralino and charginos in the list?</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c9">In this context, only gauge eigenstates are given. The charginos and neutralinos are explained while mentioning the mass eigenstates in Section 3.1.1.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">9. P16: why MUST it be broken?</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c5">Because we haven&rsquo;t observed any SUSY particles so far. If SUSY were exact, we would have observed selectrons exactly at the same mass as electrons, which has not happened.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">10. P17. Table 3.1: I think you should mention what each column represents in the below table? For example, what is S? &nbsp;Spin? Always good to mention the details of the table in the caption.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c10 c14">Thanks for pointing this out, we have changed the text accordingly. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">11. P17: &ldquo;and s is the spin of a particle.&rdquo; which particle? SUSY or SM particles?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">It can be any particle, SUSY or SM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">12. Do you have a diagram of how R-parity violation implies protons are unstable? No need to put in the thesis but for your information.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Proton decay is not possible within the SM due to the baryon number conservation. However, for R-parity violating SUSY scenarios, we can preserve the gauge symmetry of the SUSY Lagrangian and introduce terms that violate lepton and baryon numbers individually. This can lead to the decay of a proton into an electron and a pi_0. Below is a Feynman diagram for such a decay in the context of R-parity violating SUSY. Note that the couplings have to be very small in order to account for such decay, since the bound on proton decay lifetime is 10^32 years.</span></p><p class="c18"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 268.50px; height: 131.49px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 268.50px; height: 131.49px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">13. Table 3.2: Never mentioned what these two particles are. They are not in Table 3.1. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">This is mentioned in Section 3.1.1 where Table 3.2 is referred to. </span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">14.P19: &quot;similar contribution...&quot; exactly the same or how much different from SM contribution? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Exact cancellation is not possible. But the Higgs mass is regulated to get rid of the quadratic divergent terms. However, there will be residual corrections from the logarithmic divergent part. This log(lambda) term in SM and SUSY will differ by the mass squared of the quark (squark). </span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">15. Fig. 3.1: Why does the blue line start at 500 GeV? Similarly, the black line ends at 1000 GeV, whereas the rest of the lines cover the whole x-axis range? </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">This is taken from the paper as indicated in the citation. The low gluino mass production is bounded by LEP and Tevatron experiments, so those points are left out. Similarly, in the context of the LHC, such high mass sfermion production is also not relevant.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">16. How many parameters are there in SM? Just for your own understanding can you show them in the thesis talk.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The SM has 19 independent parameters: 9 Yukawa couplings, 3 angles and 1 CP-violating phase in the CKM matrix, 3 coupling strengths, the &mu; and &lambda; parameters of the Higgs potential, and QCD vacuum angle &theta; linked to the strong CP problem. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">17. P22: how is it different from SUSY Chi_1^0? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c5">It is different by mass as described in Section 3.1.1. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">18. Fig. 3.2: &quot;100% branching fraction&quot; Do you think this is a reasonable assumption? If yes, based on what argument? </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Yes, I think it is a reasonable assumption. We don&#39;t know if SUSY is there. So, the exact branching fractions of different processes are yet unknown. If there is any sign of SUSY first, we can look for discovery channels and determine the exact production cross-sections later. Our analysis strategy favors the production of Z bosons in the final state. So to maximize the production cross-section, we assumed a 100% branching fraction. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">19. P28: what is the meaning of interaction length over 10? Is it radiation length? Are the interaction length and radiation lengths the same? </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The sentence is a bit confusing, so we have changed it to &ldquo;The presence of the HO effectively increases the thickness of the HCAL and provides over 10 times the interaction length as compared to no HO, thus improving the energy resolution.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, (nuclear) interaction length and radiation length are not the same. </span><span class="c2">Interaction length</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;is the mean distance traversed by a hadron before undergoing an inelastic nuclear interaction and its energy reduces to 1/e times the initial value. </span><span class="c2">Radiation length</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;is a characteristic of a material, related to the 1-1/e th energy loss of high-energy electromagnetic particles interacting with it. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">20. P28: but the same can be done with x and y coordinate, why use eta and phi? </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">We know that the collision is happening along the z-direction and the CM frame is always a preferable choice. In CMS, the interaction between the p-p is not a pointlike interaction, rather a parton-parton scattering leading to several vertices. If we had done calculations in x-y coordinates, we would run into trouble while reconstructing objects like hadronic jets, since the delta-theta (angle between two final state hadrons or particles) in the x-y plane is not a Lorentz invariant quantity. &nbsp;Whereas, if we go to a (E,pt,eta,phi) plane, variables like delta-eta, delta-phi are Lorentz invariant in the transverse plane.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">21. P31: Do you mean ECAL is 25*89cm ~ 22m depth? </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c5">This is clearly a typo. Thank you for pointing this out. We have fixed the text to 0.89 cm.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">22. Fig. 4.5: There are no places in the figure which says &ldquo;ECAL&rdquo;? Maybe the caption can be made clear.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The caption is changed to &ldquo;A schematic diagram of the ECAL showing its different components. The ECAL crystals in a supermodule, preshowers, supercrystals, dee and modules are shown as labeled&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">23. P42: Can there be other methods or ways to pick PV except for the highest pt^2 of tracks? Also, why pt^2, why not pt?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">A number of other track variables other than pt^2, such as </span><span class="c9">the</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;number of tracks associated with the vertex, the sum of track weights, the largest track pt</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">in the vertex, the scalar &sum;pt_</span><span class="c9">i</span><span class="c9">, where i spans the three tracks with largest pt</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;etc. can be used to pick PV (see </span><span class="c12"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/jsp/db_notes/noteInfo.jsp?cmsnoteid%3DCMS%2520AN-2011/129&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1611874621790000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0KfDIMFAg7z3kvOQlWf48Q">CMS-AN-11-129</a></span><span class="c9">). At present, the pt^2 ordering is mostly used. </span><span class="c5">Here, by nominal PV, we mean the PV corresponding to the &ldquo;signal&rdquo;. Since the pt^2 is the scalar sum of all tracks coming from the vertex, the RMS sum is preferred over the pt sum.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">24. Eq. (4.5): is it optimized? If yes what is optimized on?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">No, it is not optimized. The m</span><span class="c9">T </span><span class="c9">requirement restricts the veto to situations consistent with a W boson decay where a W can give rise to tau which further gives rise to the isolated pion tracks (W boson mT&lt;100 GeV for different pt^W).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">25. P48: Is this true? I thought most of them decay close to PV?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">Yes, the B-hadrons decay very close to PV with a typical decay flight-length of about 200 &#x1d77b;m. With the excellent impact parameter resolution the pixel detector has (ranging between 10 and 15 &#x1d77b;m), we are able to locate the secondary decay vertices inside a jet. These provide a tell-tale signature of the jet initiated by a b quark.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">26. P49: This is a vector but transverse energy is scalar?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Well, being the magnitude of the missing transverse momentum vector, MET is a scalar quantity. To denote the missing transverse momentum (MET) vector, we have always used the vector symbol on p_T^miss.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">27. P52: what is special about this value or why this small splitting?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">This small splitting ensures enough boost to the final state Z boson. One can also choose models with higher splittings and perform the similar study. Our search is sensitive as long as the Z bosons are sufficiently boosted. We ensure it by fixing the splitting at 50 GeV. An alternative model where the splitting between gluino and NLSP is taken as half of the sum of gluino and LSP masses is taken and the effect on Z-boson reconstruction efficiency and the sensitivity of the search is tested. In such a scenario, the light quark jets can also become boosted after a certain threshold of the mass splitting becomes higher.

P52: if you would have taken a range 1-10 GeV, would it still not correspond to high Z momentum?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">Yes, absolutely. One can go higher in LSP masses. We tested this for higher LSP masses and a similar scan is possible where LSP is larger, as long as the Zs&rsquo; are boosted.

D 88 (2013) 052017</a></span><span class="c5">] has been added to the thesis to clarify this nomenclature.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">30. P52: At the same time your background can be messy compared to the leptonic modes of Z? If so, please mention it in the thesis.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">Thanks, we added a phrase &ldquo;</span><span class="c10">although they suffer from a higher background contamination compared to the leptonic Z decay.</span><span class="c5">&rdquo; to the end of the sentence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">31. P52: Can you add a sentence on feasibility? Which one can give a better limit and why?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">It would be difficult to tell which can give a better limit without a full-fledged study. Though a complete rerun with Run-2 boosted Higgs boson analysis is on its way and is showing similar exclusion limits as ours. The main purpose of our comment is to convey that the two analyses are based on complementary approaches. The Higgs analysis uses the b-tagged events to reconstruct the Higgs bosons, whereas we do not rely on b-tagged jets.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">32. P52: Please include the diagrams so see actually they have a similar final state as T5ZZ.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c5">We have added the suggested diagrams in Sec. 5.3.2.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">33. Sec. 5.3.2: Can you please add a few more details about what each of the packages does in MC generation? For example, PYTHIA, POWHEG, MadGraph. Are they all used and at that stage and what is the role of each in your MC generation?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I would prefer you put the Feynman diagrams for backgrounds in this subsection so that one can see the final state to compare why they are the backgrounds to your signal decay.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">OK. We have added some text as &ldquo;</span><span class="c10">PYTHIA is a standard tool for event generation in high-energy collisions based on a set of physics models. It contains a directory of all hard processes, models for initial- and final-state parton showers, matching and merging methods between hard processes and parton showers, multiparton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. MadGraph is a matrix element generator, which generates MC events based on parton-level event diagrams. POWHEG is a similar tool that uses positive weight hardest emission for providing the parton-shower modeling. Most of the MC samples used in this analysis are generated by using a combination of PYTHIA and MadGraph unless otherwise mentioned.</span><span class="c5">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Concerning the second point, we have added three figures for the background event diagrams and referred them at appropriate places in the main text.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">34. P54: last line: I think the data luminosity mentioned in the table doesn&rsquo;t add up to exactly 137 fb^-1. Can you please put the exact value?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">The exact value is 136.51 fb^-1. Given the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 2.5%, it is probably OK to round it off to 137 fb^-1.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">35. P58: What is the search region? Maybe you should describe that your analysis needs to split the data into two regions: one is the search region and the other is the control region. Then describe each region.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">Yes, we indeed describe this later in Sections 5.7.1 and 5.7.3. We have added here one line saying &ldquo;</span><span class="c10">More details on the SR and CRs including their definitions can be found in Sec.~\ref{sec:signalregion} and~\ref{sec:controlregion}.</span><span class="c5">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">36. Fig. 5.2: I don&rsquo;t see the P_T^miss variable &ldquo;by the name&rdquo; used in these plots? Do you mean MET? </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Thanks for pointing this out, the plot is updated with p_T^miss since we used that nomenclature throughout the thesis.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">37. Fig. 5.3: why does the black curve fall off after 800 GeV even though there is no data point after 800 GeV &nbsp;(right plot)?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">This happens due to the choice of the fit parameters. It is fixed in the revised version of the thesis. </span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">38. P61: how do you make sure there are two Z-bosons with only two jets? Is it due to a boosted region?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Yes, we have a pT requirement of 200 GeV on the two leading AK8 jets which ensures that the two Z bosons are boosted each leading to a large-radius jet. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">39. P62: what is the definition of the isolated track or isolated photon?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Isolated tracks are described in Sec. 4.5.6. Isolated photon, electron or muon is meant by the reconstructed photons, electrons or muons are described in 4.5.3-4.5.5.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">40. &ldquo;ECAL L1 prefiring issue&rdquo;: what is this exactly?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">During 2017 data taking, the gradual timing shift of ECAL was not properly propagated to L1 trigger primitives in 2016 and 2017. As a result, by the end of 2017, a large fraction of L1 E-Gamma objects at eta &gt;2.0 were associated with the previous bunch crossing. This led to &ldquo;self veto&rdquo; of events, as the L1 trigger forbade consecutive bunch crossings to fire. This is known as the ECAL L1 prefiring issue. More details can be found in Appendix A.1.1.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">41. What is HEM?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">During 2018 data taking, the Hadron Endcap Module (HEM) 15 and 16 were disabled. Thus the name HEM came. &nbsp;More details can be found in Appendix A.1.2.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">42. P63: what happens to your MET definition for these events? Is it redefined?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">No, the MET is not redefined but the parts of the detector information is vetoed while calculating the MET.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">43: Fig. 5.4: Don&rsquo;t you think it would have been better to put data points in the plots? Also if I understand correctly your Ht threshold is 300 GeV (or did I miss it) whereas your top left plot for Ht starts from 400 GeV.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Our strategy has been not to show the data points in any of the plots at the selection level. Instead they are shown once we go to the bkg estimation method as the latter is data driven. Thus, we would prefer to leave it this way unless it is absolutely critical. Also the threshold of HT is at 400 GeV as mentioned in Section 5.6.1.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">44. Fig. 5.10: what sample constitutes &ldquo;Other SM&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The other SM consists of Drell-Yan and diboson productions from Tables 5.6 and 5.7.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">45. Fig. 5.11: How is this SR defined? It is highly asymmetric around Z mass.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Due to the jet pruning (using the softdrop method), the softdrop mass is not the Z mass, rather it peaks at around 85 GeV (Fig.5.12). Thus we choose the window which is symmetric about the softdrop mass.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">46. P70: [70,100] GeV, Is this range tuned or optimized?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">This range is taken as it retains 85% of the signal. It is not exactly optimized, but the choice is mostly based on the symmetry around the soft-drop mass peak (around 85 GeV). Any systematics due to the signal contamination to the mass sidebands are included as described in the last paragraph of Sec. 6.1.2.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">47. Fig. 5.13: what fraction is TRUE Z-&gt; q\bar{q} or in other words truth matched Z? </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The fraction of truth-matched Z is above 98%.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">48. Fig. 5.13: why is there a jump in (top-left) solid points at around 1050 GeV and 1200 GeV?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">This is happening due to the choice of a comparatively small gluino mass point. The efficiency is increasing with the increase in Z-boson pT at low gluino mass (1.3 TeV). For higher gluino masses, the Z boson has enough boost, so there is no sudden jump as seen in the bottom plot.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">49. P74: you mean &ldquo;\nu\nubar&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c5">Thanks for pointing this out. Now it is fixed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">50. P74: nubar?</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c9">Fixed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">51. Fig. 5.15: are they expected with the used data luminosity or there is a multiplication factor (normalized to larger data luminosity)?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">It is the first one i.e. expected signal events from an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">52. Eq. 5.2: why not use Pt dependent TF rather than single averaged value?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">We think you mean MET dependent TF here. We don&rsquo;t need it, since we only have one fit for the integrated MET bin. We have tested the fit in all six MET bins and found that the fit shape is consistent among different MET bins within uncertainty. So it is appropriate to use MET inclusive TF.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">53. Fig. 5.17: Is the lower panel a fit to a straight line?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Yes, the lower panel is fitted to both a straight line and a constant to compute the relative uncertainty in each bin. However, the linear fit is not shown in these plots.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">54. Fig. 5.19: what is going on with the 2nd bin data point? almost 30% higher than the nearby points. Also due to the second point, the whole PDF is pulled up, otherwise, if you remove 2nd data then you can see the PDF is ABOVE almost 90% of data points?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The second point is a just wide (~2sigma) statistical fluctuation.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">55. Fig. 5.20: There are slight systematic higher data entries in lower mass bins, is it understood?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9">Yes, this comes due to the low QCD statistics at the low mass region, which is dominated by QCD multijet events. In the higher mass sideband, there is no effect due to the QCD since the contribution is negligible.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">56. P84: MC statistics, what exactly is done to get 1-2% uncertainty?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">This uncertainty due to MC statistics is obtained from the Poissonian uncertainty in the generated MC events.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">57. P91: Is theta here still the nuisance parameter as mentioned earlier on page 90 first para? </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c9">Yes, it is the same nuisance parameter.</span></p><div><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c14 c16"></span></p></div></body></html>
